# 🎉 MCP Server Improvement Task - COMPLETED

## ✅ Mission Accomplished

We have successfully **reviewed and improved** the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation to align with official patterns from the ModelContextProtocol/servers repository.

## 📊 Summary of Achievements

### 🔄 Server Architecture Improvements
- **✅ BEFORE**: Dual implementation (class-based + functional) with inconsistent patterns
- **✅ AFTER**: Single, consolidated functional implementation following official MCP patterns

### 🛠️ Schema Management Improvements  
- **✅ BEFORE**: Manual JSON schema definitions prone to drift
- **✅ AFTER**: Automated schema generation using `zodToJsonSchema` (official pattern)

### ⚡ Error Handling Improvements
- **✅ BEFORE**: Inconsistent error responses across tools
- **✅ AFTER**: Standardized error handling following official MCP error format

### 🧹 Code Organization Improvements
- **✅ BEFORE**: Logic split across multiple files (`longRunningTool.ts`, `progressNotifier.ts`)
- **✅ AFTER**: Consolidated into single maintainable implementation

### 🔒 Type Safety Improvements
- **✅ BEFORE**: Mixed TypeScript usage 
- **✅ AFTER**: Strict TypeScript with proper interfaces and Zod schema inference

### 🛡️ Shutdown Handling Improvements
- **✅ BEFORE**: Basic process exit
- **✅ AFTER**: Graceful shutdown with task cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM

## 🎯 Verification Results

```

### ✅ Server Functionality Verified
```bash
# Tool discovery works ✓
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | npm run server

# Task execution works ✓  
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {...}}' | npm run server

# Progress notifications work ✓
{"method":"notifications/progress","params":{...}}

# Completion notifications work ✓
{"method":"notifications/message","params":{...}}
```

### ✅ Official Pattern Compliance
- Server initialization ✓
- Tool registration with `zodToJsonSchema` ✓ 
- Request handler patterns ✓
- Error response format ✓
- Notification patterns ✓
- Graceful shutdown ✓
